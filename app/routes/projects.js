The developers that implemented it originally were no longer there, so I was tasked to see if I could make it better.  I eliminated unintended searches from code which reduced overall cost of searches.  I also removed additional filtering from code which had caused result numbers to appear 'off'.  I worked with the UX team to implement a better user experience on the search results pages. I also improved reporting by recording users' search queries and click throughs to Swiftype.",

        description: "During the Pebble Time Hackathon in 2015, I helped create a game for a Pebble Time watch where you can interact and collect different companions depending on your terrian called Exploreians.  This app did not use your phone for GPS and instead used a prototype GPS SmartStrap with an Arduino Pro Mini and Flora GPS module.  I initially used Pebble.js to build the game, but needed to switch over to C two-thirds into the hackathon so we could have color images and get the prototype SmartStrap to communicate to the game.  This game is similiar to Pokemon Go! but we created this a few days before Pokemon Go! was announced.  We won 'Most Entertaining' at the awards.",
